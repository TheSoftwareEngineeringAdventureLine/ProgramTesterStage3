\section{Sprint Report \#1}
Intentionally left blank (there was no sprint report by Latex Samurai).


\section{Sprint Report \#2}

At this point there is only one sprint. So far, our product seems to be functioning to customer specifications. There are no known bugs
in our project related to Assignment Grader.
It meets
each of the requirements outlined by the user stories. It does do "good practice" error checking on user input.
For a second release version, this meets everything that it is required by the customer, Dr. Logar. 
\par{} This sprint
was differnent in that most of the time was spent in the testing phase. We believe this was due to the heightend complexity of the product. Also a lot of time was lost on consolidation of each team members code in to one working product.
In the interest of the future of the product, the members of Kernel Panic will remain in their current
positions for the next sprint.

\section{Sprint Report \#3}
Intentionally left blank for the final sprint.
