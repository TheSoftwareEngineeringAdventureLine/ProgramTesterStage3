\section{Project  Management Approach}
The approach taken to manage this project is {\tt scrum}. The project is broken into tasks to be completed over two-week sprints. The tasks are listed in {\tt Spring Backlog} in Trello. During the sprint, the team meets for ten to twenty-minute scrum meetings to explain their progress, next steps, and impediments. After each meeting, the whiteboard notes are posted as images to the appropriate Trello board.


\section{Phase  Overview}
Once a team member starts a given task, then the task is moved from {\tt Spring Backlog} to {\tt In Progress}. A done task is then moved to {\tt Ready for Testing} tab. After a completed task is tested, it is stamped as {\tt Complete}. Then the member moves to the next task. After each sprint the tasks are moved from complete to {\tt Product Backlog}
