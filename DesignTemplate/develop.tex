\chapter{Development Environment}
The basic purpose for this section is to give a developer all of the necessary 
information to setup their development environment to run, test, and/or develop. 


\section{Development IDE and Tools}
This program was developed in a Linux environment. The g++ compiler was used for compilation and generic text editors were used to write the code (QT,gedit,etc.).

\section{Source  Control}
Git was used for source control in the project. Our repository is setup on the GitHub website at
\url{https://github.com/TheSoftwareEngineeringAdventureLine/ProgramTesterStage3}


\section{Dependencies}
There are no atypical dependencies to compile and run this program, other than the C++ Standard Library.

\section{Build  Environment}
The program may be built using the g++ compiler on linux. There is also a {\tt Makefile} which allows the user to type {\tt make} to compile the program.
The following is the most common way to use g++ to compile the source code: 

\begin{lstlisting}
g++ -o test test.cpp
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip
The following is the included make file:

\begin{lstlisting}
# Use the GNU C/C++ compiler:
CC = gcc
CPP = g++

# COMPILER OPTIONS:

CFLAGS = -c

#OBJECT FILES
OBJS = test.o

tester: test.o
	${CPP} -lm ${OBJS} -o tester
test.o: test.cpp
clean:
	rm -f *.o tester
realclean:
	rm -f *.o tester *~ *.swp
\end{lstlisting}
