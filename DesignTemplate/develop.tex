\chapter{Development Environment}
The basic purpose for this section is to give a developer all of the necessary 
information to setup their development environment to run, test, and/or develop. 


\section{Development IDE and Tools}
This program was developed in a Linux environment. The g++ compiler was used for compilation and generic text editors were used to write the code (QT,gedit,etc.).

\section{Source  Control}
Git was used for source control in the project. Our repository is setup on the GitHub website. However, it is private and can only be accessed once a developer is deemed a collaborator. 


\section{Dependencies}
There are no atypical dependencies to compile and run this program. 

\section{Build  Environment}
The program may be built using the g++ compiler on linux. There is also a {\tt Makefile} which allows the user to type {\tt make} to compile the program.
